# How to get support for Astrotomic packages

There are multiple ways to get support/resolve questions, please choose the one that fits best for your question.

## Readme / Documentation

Every package comes with a `README.md` and some also with a dedicated documentation. Please read through them before raising up an issue. If you still have a question, don't hesitate to use one of the following options.

## GitHub Issues

Every package has the [Issues](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) enabled. For questions that aren't related to security you can use issues. These will be answered as soon as possible and possibly others from the community will join in to help or benefit from your question.
Before creating your own/new issue please search if there's already an issue related to your question you can join (still open) or link in yor one.

## Twitter

Astrotomic has it's own twitter account - for short (tweet size) questions you can mention  [@astrotomic_oss](https://twitter.com/astrotomic_oss) at Twitter. If you want to add a code-snippet we recommend [carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/).

## Email

That's the last option and primary/only thought for [security](SECURITY.md) issues. If you found a vulnerability send an email to [dev@astrotomic.info](mailto:dev@astrotomic.info). Please don't use this email for general support questions.
